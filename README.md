## SCSN

A deep learning method for remote sensing image cross-scene generalization.

## Requirement

* python 3
* pytorch 1.10 or above

## Datasets

Four scene classification datasets are used in our experiments: `AID, CLRS, MLRSN, and RSSCN7`. Since they are all public benchmarks, they will not be provided here. Just get them by yoursef.

For more information on the scene classification (or more tasks) dataset, check out this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9393553).

./data/xxx.txt is to show samples in our experiment. This is not the way our code reads data.

If you want to use your own dataset, please organize your data in the following structure.

```
RootDir
└───Domain1Name
│   └───Class1Name
│       │   file1.jpg
│       │   file2.jpg
│       │   ...
│   ...
└───Domain2Name
|   ...    
```

And then, modifty `util/util.py` to contain the dataset.

The specific image suffixes supported can be referred to torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder.

## Usage

1. Modify the file in the scripts.

2. The main script file is `train.py`, which can be runned by using run.sh from scripts/run.sh.

## Customization

**It is easy to design your own method following the steps:**

1. Add your method (a Python file) to `alg/algs`, and add the reference to it in the `alg/alg.py`.

2. Modify `utils/util.py` to make it adapt your own parameters.

3. Modify `scripts/run.sh` and execuate it.

## Results

Here we provide two results, more can be found in our paper.
